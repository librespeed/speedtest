## Introduction
In this document, we will introduce an XHR based HTML5 Speedtest and see how to use it.
This test measures download speed, upload speed, ping, jitter, packet loss and collects geolocation data from [http://ipinfo.io](http://ipinfo.io/developers#terms-of-use).

First of all, the requirements to run this test:

* The browser have to support XHR Level 2 and Web Workers and Javascript must be enabled.
    * Internet Explorer 11
    * Microsoft Edge 12+
    * Mozilla Firefox 12+
    * Google Chrome / Chromium 31+
    * Apple Safari 7.1+
    * Opera 18+
* Client side, the test can use up to 500 megabytes of RAM
* Server side, you'll need a fast connection (at least 100 Mbps recommended), and the web server must accept large POST requests (up to 20 megabytes).
  Apache2 and PHP are recommended, but not mandatory.

If this looks good, let's proceed and see how to use the test.


## Installation
To install the test on your server, upload the following files:

* `speedtest_worker.min.js`
* `.htaccess`
* `apache2_dynamic/php/*`

Enable mod_rewrite:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html

Accept directory specific configuration changes or put the rewrite rules directly into your .conf:

https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#allowoverride

You may also want to upload one of the examples to test it.  
Later we'll see how to use the test without PHP.

__Important:__ keep the directory structure exactly as in apache2_dynamic example or update the .htaccess to handle your custom routes


## Usage
To run the test, you need to do 3 things:

* Create the worker
* Write some code that handles the responses coming from the worker
* Start the test

### Creating the worker
```js
var w = new Worker("speedtest_worker.min.js")
```

__Important:__ use the minified version, it's smaller!

### Response handler
First, we set up a timer that fetches the status of the worker continuously:
```js
var timer = setInterval(function () {
  w.postMessage('status')
}, 100)
```

Then we write a response handler that receives the status and updates the page. Later
we'll see the details of the format of the response.

```js
w.onmessage = function (event) {
  var data = event.data.split(';')
  var testState = data[0]
  var dlStatus = data[1]
  var ulStatus = data[2]
  var pingStatus = data[3]
  var jitterStatus = data[5]
  var packetLoss = data[7]
  var clientIp = data[4]
  var testServer = data[6]
  var country = data[8]
  var region = data[9]
  var isp = data[10]

  if (testState >= 4) {
    clearInterval(timer) // test is finished or aborted
  }
  // .. update your page here ..
}
```

#### Response format
The response from the worker is composed of values separated by `;` (semicolon) in this
format:

`testState;dlStatus;ulStatus;pingStatus;clientIp;jitterStatus;pointOfTest;packetLoss;country;region;isp`

* __testState__ is an integer 0-5
    * `0` = Test starting
    * `1` = Download test in progress
    * `2` = Ping + Jitter test in progress
    * `3` = Upload test in progress
    * `4` = Test finished
    * `5` = Test aborted
* __dlStatus__ is either
    * Empty string (not started or aborted)
    * Download speed in Megabit/s as a number with 2 digits
    * The string "Fail" (test failed)
* __ulStatus__ is either
    * Empty string (not started or aborted)
    * Upload speed in Megabit/s as a number with 2 digits
    * The string "Fail" (test failed)
* __pingStatus__ is either
    * Empty string (not started or aborted)
    * Estimated ping in milliseconds as a number with 2 digits
    * The string "Fail" (test failed)
* __clientIp__ is either
    * Empty string (not fetched yet or failed)
    * The client's IP address as a string
* __jitterStatus__ is either
    * Empty string (not started or aborted)
    * Estimated jitter in milliseconds as a number with 2 digits (lower = stable connection)
    * The string "Fail" (test failed)
* __pointOfTest__ is either
    * Empty string for a single server test or failure on list retrieval
    * URI of a CORS enabled traffic generator
* __packetLoss__ is an integer with ping tests failures
* __country__ ISO Alpha-2 country code of client's origin country (http://ipinfo.io/developers#terms-of-use)
* __region__ Client's origin region (http://ipinfo.io/developers#terms-of-use)
* __isp__ Internet Service Provider name (http://ipinfo.io/developers#terms-of-use)

### Starting the test
To start the test, send the start command to the worker:

```js
w.postMessage('start')
```

This starts the test with the default settings, which is usually the best choice. If you want, you can change these settings and pass them to the worker as JSON with like this:

```js
w.postMessage('start {"param1": "value1", "param2": "value2", ...}')
```

#### Test parameters
* __time_dl__: How long the download test should be in seconds
    * Default: `15`
    * Recommended: `>=5`

    * Default: `false`
* __force_fetchAPI__: forces the use of Fetch API on all browsers that support it
    * Default: `false`
Fetch API are used if the following conditions are met:
    * allow_fetchAPI is true
    * Chromium-based browser with support for Fetch API and enable_quirks is true
OR force_fetchAPI is true and the browser supports Fetch API

### Aborting the test prematurely
The test can be aborted at any time by sending an abort command to the worker:

```js
w.postMessage('abort')
```

This will terminate all network activity and stop the worker.

__Important:__ do not simply kill the worker while it's running, as it will leave pending XHR requests!


## Using the test without PHP
If your server does not support PHP, or you're using something newer like Node.js, you can still use this test by replacing `garbage.php`, `empty.php` and `getIP.php` with equivalents.

### Replacements

#### Replacement for `garbage.php`
A replacement for `garbage.php` must generate incompressible garbage data.

A large file (10-100 Mbytes) is a possible replacement. You can get [one here](http://downloads.fdossena.com/geth.php?r=speedtest-bigfile).

If you're using Node.js or some other server, your replacement should accept `beautiful` URLs via GET (/download/chunkSize) which tells it how many megabytes of garbage to generate.
It is important here to turn off compression, and generate incompressible data.
A symlink to `/dev/urandom` is also ok.

#### Replacement for `empty.php`
Your replacement must simply respond with a HTTP code 200 and send nothing else. You may want to send additional headers to disable caching.

#### Replacement for `getIP.php`
Your replacement must simply respond with the client's IP as plaintext. Nothing fancy.

### JS
You need to start the test with your replacements like this:

```js
w.postMessage('start {"url_dl": "newGarbageURL", "url_ul": "newEmptyURL", "url_ping": "newEmptyURL", "url_getIp": "newIpURL"}')
```


## Known bugs and limitations
* __Chrome:__ high CPU usage from XHR requests with very fast connections (like gigabit).
  For this reason, the test may report inaccurate results if your CPU is too slow. (Does not affect most computers)
* __IE11:__ the upload test is not precise on very fast connections
* __Safari:__ works, but needs more testing and tweaking for very fast connections

## Making changes
Since this is an open source project, you can modify it.

To make changes to the speedtest itself, edit `speedtest_worker.js`

To create the minified version, use UglifyJS like this:

```
uglifyjs -c --screw-ie8 speedtest_worker.js > speedtest_worker.min.js
```
